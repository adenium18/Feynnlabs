 McDonald’s Market Segment Attractiveness Criteria

Several key features need to be considered when evaluating which market segments are attractive for McDonald's. These criteria help ensure that the chosen segments align with McDonald's strengths and strategic goals. The criteria can be divided into **knock-out criteria** and **segment attractiveness criteria**.

#### Knock-out Criteria
1. **Homogeneity**: The target segment should consist of members who are similar in a key characteristic. This ensures that the marketing strategies developed are effective for the entire segment.
2. **Distinctiveness**: The target segment should differ substantially from other segments in a key characteristic. This helps in clearly distinguishing the segment from others.
3. **Size**: The segment must be large enough to justify the costs and efforts involved in developing and implementing a customized marketing mix.
4. **Match with McDonald's Strengths**: The segment should align with McDonald's strengths, meaning the members must be open to eating at fast food restaurants rather than rejecting them outright.
5. **Identifiability**: There must be a way to identify the members of the target segment among the broader consumer base.
6. **Reachability**: Effective channels of communication and distribution must exist to target the members of the segment specifically.

#### Segment Attractiveness Criteria
1. **Positive Perception of McDonald’s**: The segment should have a favorable view of McDonald's, indicating a potential for frequent patronage.
2. **Frequency of Eating Out**: The segment should consist of individuals who frequently eat out, as this increases the likelihood of them visiting McDonald's.
3. **Preference for Fast Food**: Members of the segment should have a preference for fast food, aligning with McDonald’s core offerings.

### Case Study: Fast Food Data Set
Given the data set contains limited information beyond people's brand image of McDonald's, the attractiveness criteria focus on:
1. **Liking McDonald’s**: This is a direct measure of the segment's positive perception of the brand.
2. **Frequency of Eating at McDonald’s**: This indicates the segment's actual behavior and loyalty to the brand.

These criteria are essential in Step 8 of the segmentation process, where they guide the selection of the target segment.

### Strategic Considerations
McDonald's management might also consider a dual approach:
- **Solidifying Existing Market Segments**: Focus on segments where McDonald's already has a high market share to maintain and grow its stronghold.
- **Exploring New Market Segments**: Investigate segments that are currently not favorable towards McDonald's, understand the underlying negative perceptions, and strategize to change these perceptions.

This comprehensive approach ensures that McDonald's not only strengthens its position in loyal segments but also expands its reach by converting less favorable segments.
